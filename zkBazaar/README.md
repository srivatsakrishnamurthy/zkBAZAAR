# zKBazaar
Towards secure, scalable, transparent on-chain private data market integrity using on-interactive zero-knowledge cryptographic proofs

## Purpose/Motive
On the Ethereum blockchain many people transact information and as a result all of these transactions are recorded. This in many cases reduces the privacy of those who wish to keep their transactions private. With the use of privacy-preserving cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs I propose a way for people to transact their data without revealing the data itself.

In the digital markets, individuals and corporations attempt to buy/sell data. To sell the data effectively, typically samples have to be provided or the data has to be anonymized and typically compromises the privacy/integrity of the data provider with respect to its stakeholders. In many cases the selling of information changes a market with the use of recommender systems when it comes to data selling [2]. In this paper, I explore a novel way to sell data in a privacy preserving manner.

## Roles of Various Users (aka Seller)

### Data Issuer
When the data is published in an ecrypted format, zKBazaar will open a part of the  data for others to preview.

### Data Receiver (aka Consumer)
Users can browse the data in the market. They can either download data that has already been funded or they can fund for data to be published. If the the user wishes to fund to recive data, they will be taken through the zKBazaar process. 

## Modules
- Circuits
	- ZKP Modules consiting of circuit code
- Contracts
	- The ETH smart contract, consiting of contract source code and etc.
